Short answer: Yes, but do it as PCR with TruncatedSVD (not PCA) and pick the number of components via time-aware CV. In practice, Ridge/ElasticNet often outperform OLS-on-PCA for sparse data.

Why/when it helps
- PCA→OLS = Principal Components Regression (PCR). It reduces dimensionality and multicollinearity, which can stabilize OLS when p >> n.
- Caveat: PCA is unsupervised. It keeps directions of highest X-variance, which aren’t necessarily the most predictive for y. Regularized models (Ridge/ElasticNet) or PLS often win.

Sparse data specifics
- Don’t use sklearn PCA on sparse matrices (it centers and densifies).
- Use TruncatedSVD, which works directly on sparse X without centering.
- Keep an intercept in the final regressor.

Recommended setup (time-aware)
- Tune n_components with TimeSeriesSplit.
- Expect the SVD output to be dense but low-dimensional.

Example: PCR for sparse X
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, Ridge
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit, GridSearchCV
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

tscv = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5)

# OLS after SVD (PCR)
pipe_pcr = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("scale", MaxAbsScaler()),              # preserves sparsity in the input
    ("svd", TruncatedSVD(random_state=42)), # sparse-friendly "PCA"
    ("ols", LinearRegression())
])

param_grid_pcr = {
    "svd__n_components": [20, 50, 100, 200, 400]  # tune this
}

search_pcr = GridSearchCV(pipe_pcr, param_grid_pcr, cv=tscv, scoring="r2", n_jobs=-1)
search_pcr.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Best CV R2 (PCR):", search_pcr.best_score_)
print("OOT R2 (PCR):", r2_score(y_test, search_pcr.predict(X_test)))
```

Often better: SVD + Ridge (or just Ridge)
```python
pipe_svd_ridge = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("scale", MaxAbsScaler()),
    ("svd", TruncatedSVD(random_state=42)),
    ("ridge", Ridge(random_state=42))
])

param_grid_svd_ridge = {
    "svd__n_components": [50, 100, 200, 400],
    "ridge__alpha": np.logspace(-4, 3, 12)
}
search_svd_ridge = GridSearchCV(pipe_svd_ridge, param_grid_svd_ridge, cv=tscv, scoring="r2", n_jobs=-1)
search_svd_ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Best CV R2 (SVD+Ridge):", search_svd_ridge.best_score_)
print("OOT R2 (SVD+Ridge):", r2_score(y_test, search_svd_ridge.predict(X_test)))
```

Notes and pitfalls
- If you keep “all” components, PCR ≈ OLS rotated; the benefit comes from truncation (small k), not PCA itself.
- Choose k by time-aware CV, not just explained variance.
- PCR can ignore rare-but-predictive one-hot levels; ElasticNet is often better for that.
- SVD creates dense scores; that’s fine if k is modest.
- If you want supervised dimensionality reduction, try PLSRegression; it can beat PCR when signal lies in low-variance directions.

If you share your n_samples, n_features, and average non-zeros per row, I can suggest a good k range and whether PCR, Ridge, or PLS is likely to win on your setup.
