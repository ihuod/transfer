Absolutely—boosting can work well on sparse data, but the best results usually come from a combination of a strong linear baseline + a tree-boosting model that natively supports sparse matrices.

Here’s a practical game plan.

What works best with sparse features
- Linear models (fast, strong baseline)
  - SGDRegressor with elastic-net penalty (handles very high-dimensional sparse data)
  - Ridge (if you want an L2-only baseline)
- Tree boosting that’s sparse-aware
  - LightGBM (excellent sparse handling; fast)
  - XGBoost (accepts SciPy sparse directly; robust)
  - CatBoost can work but tends to be slower on huge sparse one-hot/text spaces
- If interactions matter and features are super high-dimensional
  - Factorization Machines (fastFM/xlearn/libFM) capture pairwise interactions efficiently

Key tips for sparse data
- Keep everything sparse. Avoid steps that densify (e.g., StandardScaler with centering, PolynomialFeatures).
- Scaling: use MaxAbsScaler or StandardScaler(with_mean=False).
- Consider dropping ultra-rare features: X.getnnz(axis=0) to filter columns appearing in too few rows.
- Use float32 to save memory.
- Zeros are usually “absence,” not missing. Don’t set zero_as_missing unless that’s intended.

Minimal, strong baselines (with code)

0) Ensure your matrices are sparse CSR
- If you have pandas sparse dtypes, convert once:
  - X_train = X_train.sparse.to_coo().tocsr()
  - X_test = X_test.sparse.to_coo().tocsr()

1) Linear baseline: SGDRegressor (elastic-net)
- Very fast, scales to millions of features, supports early stopping.

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import MaxAbsScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import SGDRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, r2_score
import numpy as np

pipe = make_pipeline(
    MaxAbsScaler(),  # safe for sparse
    SGDRegressor(
        loss="huber",           # robust to outliers; use "squared_error" for pure MSE
        penalty="elasticnet",
        alpha=1e-4,
        l1_ratio=0.1,           # tune this
        max_iter=5000,
        tol=1e-3,
        early_stopping=True,
        n_iter_no_change=5,
        random_state=42
    )
)

pipe.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = pipe.predict(X_test)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
print({"rmse": rmse, "mae": mae, "r2": r2})
```

2) LightGBM (sparse-aware boosting)
- Great performance on sparse; supports early stopping.

```python
import lightgbm as lgb
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

lgbm = lgb.LGBMRegressor(
    objective="l2",             # or "huber" if you have outliers
    learning_rate=0.05,
    n_estimators=5000,          # use early stopping
    num_leaves=31,              # tune with max_depth
    max_depth=-1,               # or set small like 8 if many features
    min_data_in_leaf=50,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.6,
    reg_lambda=1.0,
    reg_alpha=0.0,
    n_jobs=-1
)

lgbm.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)],
    eval_metric="rmse",
    early_stopping_rounds=200,
    verbose=100
)

y_pred = lgbm.predict(X_test, num_iteration=lgbm.best_iteration_)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
print({"rmse": rmse})
```

3) XGBoost (sparse-aware boosting)
- Also very strong; “hist” method is efficient.

```python
import xgboost as xgb
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

xgb_reg = xgb.XGBRegressor(
    objective="reg:squarederror",
    n_estimators=4000,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    max_depth=8,            # keep moderate; high depth + sparse often overfits
    min_child_weight=1.0,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.6,
    reg_lambda=1.0,
    reg_alpha=0.0,
    tree_method="hist",     # use "gpu_hist" if you have a GPU
    n_jobs=-1,
    random_state=42
)

xgb_reg.fit(
    X_train, y_train,
    eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)],
    eval_metric="rmse",
    early_stopping_rounds=200,
    verbose=100
)

y_pred = xgb_reg.predict(X_test)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
print({"rmse": rmse})
```

Optional: Factorization Machines (if interactions matter)
- Great for very sparse one-hot/text where pairwise interactions help.

```python
# pip install fastFM
from fastFM import sgd
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

fm = sgd.FMRegression(
    n_iter=200, step_size=0.01, init_stdev=0.1,
    rank=16,                 # interaction rank; tune this
    l2_reg_w=0.1, l2_reg_V=0.1
)
fm.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = fm.predict(X_test)
rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred, squared=False)
print({"rmse": rmse})
```

Feature pruning for ultra-sparse matrices
- Drop features that appear in very few rows (keeps it sparse and reduces noise):

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import sparse

min_df = 10  # appears in at least 10 rows
col_counts = np.asarray(X_train.getnnz(axis=0)).ravel()
mask = col_counts >= min_df
X_train = X_train[:, mask]
X_test = X_test[:, mask]
```

When to prefer which
- Very high dimensional (hundreds of thousands to millions of features): start with SGDRegressor (elastic-net). It’s hard to beat for speed and often for accuracy.
- Moderate dimension or when you expect non-linearities/interaction effects: LightGBM or XGBoost with early stopping.
- If your features are one-hot/text and interactions matter a lot: try Factorization Machines or combine FM + linear/GBDT.

A few extra knobs to try
- Targets with heavy tails: consider log1p transform (if y > 0), or use Huber/quantile loss in boosting.
- Time-based OOT: use time-aware CV (e.g., expanding window) to select hyperparameters.

Quick questions to tailor this better
- How big are X_train and X_test (n_samples, n_features, % non-zeros)?
- Are zeros “absence” or truly missing values?
- What evaluation metric matters most (RMSE, MAE)?
- Any time or group structure (time-based OOT, groups that must not leak)?
- Do you have a GPU?

If you share shapes and a bit about y’s distribution, I can suggest tighter hyperparameters and which model to prioritize.
